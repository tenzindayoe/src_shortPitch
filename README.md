# shortpitchsource


Contains the source code for short pitch ai

Note, since the backend uses the GCloud cli , it needs to be set on the device.
Also most of the api keys have been removed since this is a public repo.

For testing, you can visit : http://shortpitchai.com  since that contains the latest build of this source code. 

frontend : contains the react application .

backend : contains the code for the fastapi server.

Thank you!
